# Tarkov-EventParser-Telegram
 The program allows you to receive specific information from the website and notify the user when required. I used it to notify me when not to join the game (halloween event sucks).

For the program to work, you need a bot token in a telegram (you can get it through FatherBot) and a chat id so that messages come only to the right chat.

The program receives data from the site at intervals so as not to create a load on the system and not engage in a similar DDOS attack. Please note that a stable internet connection is required for correct operation.

Website during the event:

Here is what can happen to you if you do not use this bot:
